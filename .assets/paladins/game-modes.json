    "lore":"The Magistrate have discovered that there is a strong power hidden in the Shattered Desert with which they can seal the victory over the Resistance. The Resistance of course want to prevent this and get unexpected amplification. The last Warder, Imani, answered the call of the beacon and wants to join the Resistance to fight against the Darkness. Furthermore they learn what this darkness is all about, when a creature from another time line warns them of the machinations of the Magistrates and joins them.",
    "overview": "A large tear in reality has appeared among the ruins of the Shattered Desert, distorting the region in strange ways. Drawn to this anomaly, both the Resistance and Magistrate have sent their forces to claim its unknown power.\n\nJoin the fray as both factions battle in the all-new End Times game mode. Players will choose from a selection of either Paladins or Magistrate Champions, as well as several neutral characters; ownership of Champions will not matter for this mode. Do the best to maintain control of the strange tear, but be aware that its unstable nature distorts the world in a new way wherever it relocates.\n\nComplete special limited time quests and purchase the new Omega Skins for Chrono-Shards to unlock up to 27 rewards, including 2 New Epic Skins. Every 2 weeks new skins will be added, new champions will be available in End Times, and quest will rotate out giving the player even more Chrono-Shards to earn.",
